# Basic Database operations-providing access to databases from middleware, part1
## Basic SQL (uppercase optional)
- SHOW DATABASES;
    - lists all databases
- USE database_name;
    - switches to chosen database;
- CREATE DATABASE database_name;
- USE database_name;
    - Switch to working with database
- CREATE TABLE table_name (column TYPE,column TYPE, PRIMARY KEY(fieldname));
- SHOW TABLES; 
    - shows tables in current DB
- DESCRIBE table_name;
    - shows structure of table
- INSERT INTO table_name (property1, property2, property3) VALUES (property1, property2, property3),(property1, property2, property3);
- SELECT
    - SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT INTEGER;
        - returns specified count of entries
    - SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE property= or < or >value
        - filters out only entries that match criteria
- UPDATE 
    - UPDATE table_name SET field_name1 = new_value1, field_name3 = new_value3;
        - Updates all fieldnames if no WHERE clause provided
    - UPDATE table_name SET field_name1 = new_value1, field_name3 = new_value3 WHERE fieldname = value;
        - Updates specific field (usually by primary key/id)

- DELETE FROM table_name;
    - deletes all items in the table if no WHERE clause specified.
- DELETE FROM table_name WHERE fieldname=<>value
    - deletes specified row/rows
- WHERE color LIKE 'Blue%'
    - % is wildcard for zero, one or multiple characters, so 'Blue', 'Blue1', or 'Blue Jeans'
- WHERE color LIKe 'gr_y'
    - _ is wildcard for a single character, so would match both gray and grey
- IS NULL mjst be used to catch a null field with WHERE clause, as comparison operators (=,<,>) won't work on it
